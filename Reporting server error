You probably renamed your VM. Open "Reporting Services Configuration Manager" (C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Microsoft SQL Server 2016\Configuration Tools). Click on the database icon on the left, and click on change database -> Choose an existing database, you will be prompted to connect to the database server and in the Server Name type your new VM's name. Then click next. Select DynamicsAXReportServer as the Report Service Database, click Next, Next and then Finish and you should be all set.
